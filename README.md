# Motivation

Driven by a passion for democratizing knowledge and contributing to the collective advancement of the AI ecosystem. Through Project Armada, I aim to share insights, experiences, and innovations, fostering a community that collaborates, learns, and grows together.Visualsof stepwise execution of some the projects have been prioritised to cater to all levels of enthusiasts, learners and developers. Where inevitable, codes will be used and a summary explanation interpreting same will be shared

Stay tuned for updates, and join me on this exciting journey into the frontiers of AI innovation!
